Whether for quick inspection or in-depth analysis, SwarmTrack turns raw coordinates into clear, dynamic visual stories.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"#table-of-contents","title":"Table of Contents","text":""},{"location":"#install-moustic","title":"Install moustic","text":"<ul> <li>Installation Steps</li> <li>Retrieve the file containing the codes and tests  </li> <li>Open a terminal  </li> <li>Check if Python is installed  </li> <li>Install Python (if needed)  </li> <li>Install pip (if not already installed)  </li> <li>Create a virtual environment  </li> <li>Retrieve the file containing the codes and tests (again if needed)  </li> <li>Install moustic  </li> <li>Open moustic  </li> <li>Install FFMPEG  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<ul> <li>General Overview</li> <li>App description  </li> <li>Requirements  </li> <li>Select a CSV data file  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#mosquitrack","title":"Mosqui'Track","text":"<ul> <li>2D and 3D Graphs  </li> <li>Trajectory Axes vs. Time  </li> <li>Distance Between Two Trajectories  </li> <li>Time Selection  </li> <li>Save a Video  </li> <li>Settings  </li> <li>Video location  </li> <li>Contact  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#mosquitlove","title":"Mosquit'Love","text":"<ul> <li>Select parameters  </li> <li>Run the program  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#mosquinvestigate","title":"Mosqu'Investigate","text":"<ul> <li>Display continuous trajectories  </li> <li>Display direction vectors  </li> <li>Color by speed  </li> <li>Color by nearest neighbors  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>For questions or suggestions, please contact: olivier.roux@ird.fr</p> <p>Project developed by Ana\u00efs DENIS as part of a Master's thesis on mosquito behavior analysis.</p>"},{"location":"install_python/","title":"Installation of moustic","text":""},{"location":"install_python/#step-1-retrieve-this-file-containing-the-codes-and-test","title":"Step 1 : Retrieve this file containing the codes and test","text":"<p>Download moustic as a ZIP file</p> <p>You can extract this folder to the directory of your choice: you will find the .zip file in your downloads.
