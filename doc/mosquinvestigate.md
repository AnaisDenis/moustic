## 1 – Display continuous trajectories  
<img src="/moustic/img/mosquinv/trace.png" />  
Enabling this option lets you view the complete trajectories of the selected objects across all 2D and 3D graphs.

## 2 – Display direction vectors

Enabling the **vector** option allows you to see the general direction in which the objects are moving.  
An additional feature is also enabled: detecting **pointed objects** (i.e., objects toward which another object is moving).  
You can adjust the settings to highlight the pointed objects:  

- The first parameter sets the minimum number of times an object must be pointed at to be considered a pointed object.  
- The second parameter sets the maximum distance from other objects that are pointing toward it.  

Pointed objects are highlighted with a diamond shape visible on the graph and in the legend.

## 3 – Color by speed  
<img src="/moustic/img/mosquinv/vitesses.png" />  
When this option is enabled, objects are colored according to their speed.

## 4 – Color by nearest neighbors  
<img src="/moustic/img/mosquinv/voisins.png" />  
When this option is enabled, objects are colored according to the number of their nearest neighbors.
