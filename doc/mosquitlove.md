## 1 – Select your parameters  
You can select several options depending on your study:  
- **rapprochements**: phase where objects are at a short distance from each other for a certain time  
- **fusions**: phase where an object disappears from tracking near another  
- **ruptures**: phase where an object appears near another  
- **fusions-ruptures**: phase where an object disappears then appears near another  
- **ruptures-fusions**: phase where an object appears then disappears near another  

You can adjust the distance threshold for approaches, the minimum duration to consider an approach, as well as the distance between two objects to consider a merging or a breakup.  

## 2 – Run the program  

After selecting your options, press **Analyze Couples**. A loading screen will appear. This may take a few moments.  
Once it finishes, you can:  
- press **Télécharger CSV**: a CSV file containing the information found in your CSV will be saved in your computer’s download folder.  
- press **Afficher les tableaux**: summary tables like those shown below will appear on the main page to display the results.  

> **Note:** This section does not take into account the choice of selected objects or the selected time in the web interface. The analysis will be performed on the entire CSV file.
