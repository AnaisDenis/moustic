moustic is an interactive platform for exploring and analyzing movement in 3D.

Originally created for the ANOFEEL project - How ANOpheles Females sEEk maLes? (ANR-15-CE35-0001-01) - it was designed to analyze video-tracking data from malaria-vector mosquitoes during their swarming and mating phase, and to detect when mating pairs form.

Although conceived for mosquito research, moustic can handle any dataset that records the location of multiple objects in space and time - whether you are studying animal behavior, particle motion, swarm robotics etc.

The moustic application includes three modules:

•	Mosqui'Track: Follow object trajectories in multiple formats, zoom in on selected paths, animate them over time, and measure distances between individuals frame by frame.
 
•	Mosqui'Love: Identify and quantify interactions: who meets whom, when, and for how long, from approach to contact to separation.
 
•	Mosqu'Investigate: Dive deeper with direction vectors, speed, and nearest-neighbor distances displayed in color gradients, perfect for spotting attraction, repulsion, and movement patterns.

Every module is packed with adjustable settings, giving you the freedom to explore your data your way. Whether for quick inspection or in-depth analysis, SwarmTrack turns raw coordinates into clear, dynamic visual stories.
